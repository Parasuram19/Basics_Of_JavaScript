# Slot Machine Game with JavaScript

This repository contains a simple Slot Machine game developed using JavaScript.  It's a great project for learning and understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the following JavaScript concepts:

* **DOM Manipulation:**  Dynamically updating the HTML content and styles using JavaScript.
* **Event Handling:**  Responding to user interactions (e.g., clicking the spin button).
* **Variables and Data Types:**  Working with variables to store game state and results.
* **Control Flow:**  Using conditional statements and loops to implement game logic.
* **Functions:**  Organizing code into reusable functions.
* **Random Number Generation:**  Generating random symbols for the slot machine reels.  *(Explain the method used - `Math.random()` etc.)*

## How to Play

1. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
2. **Click the "Spin" button** to start the game.
3. The reels will spin and display random symbols.
4. If you get a winning combination, you win! *(Explain the winning combinations.)*
5. Your score/balance will be updated. *(Explain how the scoring system works.)*

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  For structuring the web page.
* **CSS:**  For styling the game.
* **JavaScript:**  For implementing the game logic and interactivity.
